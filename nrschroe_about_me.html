        <p>My name is Noah Schroeder, I am a junior in the iSchool at Syracuse University.
            I was born in Connecticut at the Yale-New Haven Hospital.
            I enjoy writing code, however I have not yet learned to master it,
            I hope that this class will allow me to fulfill this dream so that I can learn
            yet another technical skill.
        </p>
        <p>I need to learn how to connect to github more efficiently
            this paragraph has no real susbtance rather is written due to
            the assignmetn instructions of this weeks in class lab.
